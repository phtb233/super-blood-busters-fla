####Super Blood Busters Notes####

#Introduction#

-Was intended as an improvement on a game made for a school project in ActionScript 2.
That game was supposed to teach about the human body.


#Issues#

-Image and sound files are too large for such a basic game.
-Took much longer than anticipated. (Almost 2 months)
-Frame rate dips due to large files and lack of pre-baked rotations.
-Numerous, unusual null errors due to half-assed programming.

#Improvements#

-Frame rate still much better than the first game's. This was due to only having one onEnterFrame.
-Looks much better, as not restricted to Flash's IDE.
-Sounds better due to sfxr.
-OOP approach makes revisiting code easier and faster.
-Lots of comments help this as well.
-Use of XML makes adding levels and customizing everything very easy.
-Embedding means this can be easily sent or submitted online.
-Able to include a high scores screen and pause menu.

#Things to do#

-Game saves
-Rest of levels
-Better soundtrack
-High scores don't work properly (the first name entry disappears for some reason)
-Music credits

#Things learnt# 

-Anatomy blurs sprite sheets very badly, so their size must be increased, making the file size huge.
-Graphics gale produces excellent, vibrant sprites, but animations would take too long.
-Anatomy animations also reduce the 'pixelated' aesthetic.
-Static vars/functions are extremely useful for games.
-Desaturate colours so that visuals don't look as flat.
